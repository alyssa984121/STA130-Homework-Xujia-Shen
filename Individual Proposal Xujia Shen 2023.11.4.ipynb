    "****Individual Proposal****\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This research aims to find out the impact of family communication and support on individuals' happiness scores during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing data from the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score(dependent varable), and the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m(independent variables). The three kinds of analysis I plan to use to explore the data would be Two-Sample Proportion Hypothesis Test, Confidence Interval, and Multiple Linear Regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "****1.Two-sample Mean Hypothesis Test****\n",
    "\n",
    "This Two-sample Mean Hypothesis Test examines the impact of family communication frequency on individuals' wellness scores, using data from the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score and the CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m. For this analysis, we choose the data in categories \"Daily or almost daily\" and \"Less than monthly.\" to finish this two-sample mean hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data of CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m will be visualized by the bar plot as this is categorical dat. A bar plot can effectively display the frequency of each category within the communication activities. By representing each category with a distinct bar, we can easily compare the number of participants who engage in various levels of communication frequency, such as \"Daily,\" \"A Few Times a Week,\" \"Weekly,\" \"A Few Times a Month,\" and \"Monthly.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we formulates the hypotheses. The null hypothesis (H0) posits that the mean wellness scores for the selected groups are equal (μ1 = μ2). The alternative hypothesis (H1) asserts that there is a significant difference in wellness scores and the mean wellness score for the group that communicates \"Daily or almost daily\" is greater than that of the group that communicates \"Less than monthly\" (μ1 > μ2). \n",
    "\n",
    "The sample for this analysis will be randomly selected to ensure representativeness and minimize bias. Assuming that the data meet the necessary conditions of normality and equal variances, an independent-samples t-test will be conducted with a significance level set at α = 0.05. If the resulting p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis will be rejected, indicating a statistically significant difference in wellness scores between the two categories. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, it suggests that there is no significant difference in wellness scores between these communication frequency groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "I predict that the p-value will be less than 0.05 and we can reject H0, indicating a statistically significant difference in wellness scores between the two categories, which means that more frequent family communication is positively associated with well-being, it is anticipated that individuals who communicate with family “Daily or almost daily” will have higher wellness scores compared to those who communicate “Less than monthly.”  This prediction supports the hypothesis that increased family interaction contributes to improved individual's happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "****2.Confidence Interval****\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis explores the connection between family social support scores and subjective happiness scale scores by calculating confidence intervals. The independent variable is the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score, which measures family support, while the dependent variable is the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For visualizing the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score data, a box plot will be employed. This visualization effectively summarizes key statistics, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, providing a clear view of the data's central tendency and variability. Additionally, the box plot facilitates side-by-side comparisons, allowing for an immediate visual assessment of differences between the high support and low support categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are categorized based on their PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score into two groups: a High Support Group with scores of 3 or higher, and a Low Support Group with scores below 3. Once organized, the mean and standard deviation of the wellness scores for each category are computed, offering insights into the central tendency and variability within each group. The sample size for each category is also recorded, reflecting the number of observations that contribute to the calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the standard error (SE) is determined using the formula SE= s/sqrt(n), where s represents the standard deviation and n denotes the sample size for each category. Typically, a confidence level of 95% is chosen, indicating that the calculated confidence interval will have a 95% probability of containing the true population mean. The margin of error (ME) is then calculated by multiplying the critical value from the t-distribution (or z-distribution for larger samples) by the standard error: ME=t×SE. Finally, the confidence interval is established using the formula Confidence Interval=Mean±Z×Standard Deviation/sqrt(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict that the High Support Group (scores ≥ 3) will have a mean wellness score of approximately 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of [3.5, 4.5]. In contrast, the Low Support Group (scores < 3) is expected to show a mean wellness score of about 2.5, with a confidence interval of [2.0, 3.0]. These predictions reflect the assumption that individuals with higher levels of family support will exhibit greater subjective happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "However,there is a possible that the confidence intervals for both groups largely overlapped, such as the High Support Group having a confidence interval of [3.5, 4.5] and the Low Support Group having an interval of [3.0, 4.0], it would suggest that the difference in wellness scores is not statistically significant. This overlap would indicate that variations in family support might not have a meaningful impact on subjective happiness, implying that the independent variable and the dependent variable are unrelated. Such results would warrant further investigation into other factors influencing wellness outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "****3.Multiple Linear Regression****\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, the dependent variable (Y) is the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score, while the independent variables (X) consist of the numerical variable PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and the categorical variable CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bar plot will be used to visualize the categorical data for CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m. The bar plot can effectively display the frequency of each communication activity category, including \"Daily,\" \"A Few Times a Week,\" \"Weekly,\" \"A Few Times a Month,\" \"Monthly,\" and \"Not in the past three months.\" A box plot will represent the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score, summarizing key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. This visualization will provide a clear view of the data's central tendency and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Multiple Linear Regression, the categorical variable will be transformed into two dummy variables based on communication frequency. The first dummy variable, CONNECTION_active, will be coded as 1 for participants who communicate \"Daily,\" \"A Few Times a Week,\" or \"Weekly,\" and 0 for those who communicate \"A Few Times a Month,\" \"Monthly,\" or \"Not in the past three months.\" The second dummy variable, CONNECTION_non_active, will be coded as 1 for participants in the latter group and 0 for those in the active group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula of the regression model is:\n",
    "WELLNESS_score=β0 + β1 X PSYCHsupport_family_subscale_score + β2 X CONNECTION_active + β3 X CONNECTION_non_active + ϵ\n",
    "\n",
    "β denotes the regression coefficients, and ϵ signifies the error term. The model will be fitted using regression analysis software or Python libraries such as statsmodels or sklearn, allowing for the estimation of each coefficient's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients associated with each independent variable provide insights into their impact on wellness. For instance, the coefficient for PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score indicates the expected change in the wellness score for each one-unit increase in social support. Furthermore, the model's overall goodness of fit will be evaluated using the R-squared value, where a higher R-squared indicates a stronger explanatory power regarding the variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the analysis of regression coefficients, we can find out the significance of PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and the categorized communication frequency on individuals' wellness and happiness. This regression model elucidates the relationship between these factors and wellness, enabling predictions of WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score based on specified levels of social support and communication frequency, thus enhancing our understanding of their influence on individuals' wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict that we have the result as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercept (β0): 1.0  \n",
    "PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score (β1): 0.5  \n",
    "CONNECTION_active (β2): 0.7  \n",
    "CONNECTION_non_active (β3): -0.3  \n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value of the model is 0.65, indicating that 65% of the variability in the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score can be explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression equation can be expressed as follows:WELLNESS_score = \n",
    "WELLNESS_score=2.0+0.5×PSYCH_support_family_subscale_score+0.7×CONNECTION_active−0.3×CONNECTION_non_active\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Intercept (β0 = 1.0): β0 = 1.0 indicates the predicted wellness score when both independent variables (social support and communication frequency) are zero. While it may not have practical significance, it serves as a baseline for the model. This means that the baseline of individual's wellness is 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score (β1 = 0.5): For each one-unit increase in family social support scores, the wellness score is expected to increase by 0.5 points, while all other factors are fixed. This suggests a positive relationship between family support and subjective happiness, indicating that higher family support contributes to greater overall wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.CONNECTION_active (β2 = 0.7): Individuals grouped in the \"active\" communication group (those who communicate daily, a few times a week, or weekly) are predicted to have a wellness score that is 0.7 points higher than those in the \"non-active\" group, assuming social support scores remain constant. This highlights the importance of regular communication with family for enhancing subjective happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.CONNECTION_non_active (β3 = -0.3): Being in the \"non-active\" group leads to a decrease of 0.3 points. This indicate that less frequent communication with family may negatively impact an individual's sense of wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value of 0.65 indicates that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the wellness scores. This suggests that family social support and the frequency of communication contribute meaningfully to understanding subjective happiness, although there may be other factors not captured in this model that could influence wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the analysis underscores the critical role of family support and communication frequency in predicting subjective wellness and happiness, providing a insights for interventions aimed at improving wellness through enhanced family connections during pademic.\n"
