    "****Individual Proposal****\n",
    "\n",
    "The research question of this research is to find out the impact of family communication and support on individuals' happiness scores during the COVID-19 pandemic, utilizing data from the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score(dependent variable), and the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m(independent variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "The variable WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score reflects individuals' self-reported happiness, while PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score measures perceived family support, and CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m captures the frequency of family interactions over the past three months. \n",
    "\n",
    "The three kinds of analysis I plan to use to explore the data would be Two-Sample Proportion Hypothesis Test, Confidence Interval, and Multiple Linear Regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "****1. Two-sample Mean Hypothesis Test****\n",
    "\n",
    "A.\n",
    "Two-sample Mean Hypothesis Test can be used to examine the impact of family communication frequency on individuals' wellness scores. For this analysis, we will use the data from WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score and CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m.  \n",
    "\n",
    "B. Visualization:\n",
    "The data of the independent variable will be visualized by the bar plot as it is categorical data. A bar plot can effectively display the frequency of each category within the communication activities. By representing each category with a distinct bar, we can easily compare the number of participants who engage in various levels of communication frequency, such as \"Daily,\" \"A Few Times a Week,\" \"Weekly,\" \"A Few Times a Month,\"  \"Monthly,\" and \"Not in the past three months.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Analysis plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we assume that the sample is randomly selected, which will help ensure that it is representative of the larger population and minimize potential biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we chose data in categories \"Daily or almost daily\" and \"Less than monthly\" to finish this two-sample mean hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we formulate the hypotheses. The null hypothesis (H0) posits that the mean wellness scores for the selected groups are equal (μ1 = μ2). The alternative hypothesis (H1) asserts that there is a significant difference in wellness scores and the mean wellness score for the group that communicates \"Daily or almost daily\" is greater than that of the group that communicates \"Less than monthly\" (μ1 > μ2). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we set the significance level at α = 0.05. If the resulting p-value is less than 0.05, the null hypothesis will be rejected, indicating a statistically significant difference in wellness scores between the two categories. Conversely, if the p-value is greater than or equal to 0.05, it suggests that there is no significant difference in wellness scores between these communication frequency groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible result：\n",
    "We predict that the p-value will be less than 0.05 and we can reject H0, indicating a statistically significant difference in wellness scores between the two categories, which means that more frequent family communication is positively associated with well-being, it is anticipated that individuals who communicate with family “Daily or almost daily” will have higher wellness scores compared to those who communicate “Less than monthly.”  This prediction supports the hypothesis that increased family interaction contributes to improved individuals' happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to course project's objectives:\n",
    "The Hypothesis Test is mentioned in lecture 5 and lecture 6. In this analysis, we applied the two-sample mean hypothesis testing method that we learned in class. We set up the null hypothesis (such as that there is no significant effect of different levels of support on wellness) and the alternative hypothesis (such as the different levels of support significantly affect wellness), and we calculated the p-value to determine the validity of the hypothesis. This process allowed us to understand how to use statistical methods to test theories and how to make decisions based on significance levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "****2. Confidence Interval****\n",
    "\n",
    "A.\n",
    "This analysis explores the connection between family social support scores and subjective happiness scale scores by calculating confidence intervals. For this analysis, we will be using the data from PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Visualization:\n",
    "For visualizing the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score data, a box plot will be employed. This visualization effectively summarizes key statistics, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers, providing a clear view of the data's central tendency and variability. Additionally, the box plot facilitates side-by-side comparisons, allowing for an immediate visual assessment of differences between the high-support and low-support categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C.  Analysis plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we assume that the sample is randomly selected, which will help ensure that it is representative of the larger population and minimize potential biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are categorized based on their PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score into two groups: a High Support Group with scores of 3 or higher, and a Low Support Group with scores below 3. Once the participants are organized into these categories, we will calculate the mean and standard deviation of the wellness scores for each group. This analysis will provide insights into the central tendency and variability of wellness scores within each group. To evaluate the differences in wellness scores between the two groups, we will establish confidence intervals to estimate the range within which the true population mean wellness scores are likely to fall. \n",
    "\n",
    "Possible result：\n",
    "\n",
    "We predict that the High Support Group (scores ≥ 3) will have a mean wellness score of approximately 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of [3.5, 4.5]. In contrast, the Low Support Group (scores < 3) is expected to show a mean wellness score of about 2.5, with a confidence interval of [2.0, 3.0]. These predictions reflect the assumption that individuals with higher levels of family support will exhibit greater subjective happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a possibility that the confidence intervals for both groups largely overlapped, such as the High Support Group having a confidence interval of [3.5, 4.5] and the Low Support Group having an interval of [3.0, 4.0], it would suggest that the difference in wellness scores is not statistically significant. This overlap would indicate that variations in family support might not have a meaningful impact on subjective happiness, implying that the independent variable and the dependent variable are unrelated. Such results would warrant further investigation into other factors influencing wellness outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to course project's objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Interval is mentioned in our lecture 4. In this section, we used the confidence interval calculation methods taught in the course. By analyzing sample data, we calculated the point estimate of the impact of family support on subjective happiness and constructed a 95% confidence interval. This will help us to understand how to assess the reliability of results through confidence intervals and how to use sample data to infer characteristics of the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "****3. Multiple Linear Regression****\n",
    "\n",
    "A. \n",
    "This analysis explores the impact of family social support scores and connection frequency on subjective happiness scale scores by using multiplelinear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Variable:\n",
    "The dependent variable (Y) is the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score. WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score represents the subjective happiness scores of individuals, indicating their self-reported level of well-being. Higher scores generally reflect a higher sense of personal happiness. \n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables (X) consist of the numerical variable PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and the categorical variable CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m.\n",
    "\n",
    "PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score measures the level of perceived social support that individuals receive from their family. It quantifies the extent to which individuals feel supported, understood, and valued by their family members. Higher scores suggest stronger perceived family support. \n",
    "\n",
    "CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m indicates the frequency of conversations or interactions that individuals had with their family over the past three months. It reflects the level of family communication, where a higher frequency suggests more regular family interactions or discussions. \n",
    "\n",
    "C. Visualization:\n",
    "The bar plot will be used to visualize the categorical data for CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m. The bar plot can effectively display the frequency of each communication activity category, including \"Daily,\" \"A Few Times a Week,\" \"Weekly,\" \"A Few Times a Month,\" \"Monthly,\" and \"Not in the past three months.\" A box plot will represent the PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score, summarizing key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and potential outliers. This visualization will provide a clear view of the data's central tendency and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Analysis plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption:\n",
    "\n",
    "In conducting this multiple linear regression analysis, we will make the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: There is a linear relationship between the dependent variable (WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score) and the independent variables (PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and CONNECTION_activities_talked_family_p3m).\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence of Residuals: The residuals of the model should be independent from one another, meaning the error of one observation does not influence another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables, which can help to ensure the reliability of predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality of Residuals: The residuals should be approximately normally distributed, which can be assessed through visualizations tests（QQ plot）.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Multiple Linear Regression, the categorical variable will be transformed into two dummy variables based on communication frequency. The first dummy variable, CONNECTION_active, will be coded as 1 for participants who communicate \"Daily,\" \"A Few Times a Week,\" or \"Weekly,\" and 0 for those who communicate \"A Few Times a Month,\" \"Monthly,\" or \"Not in the past three months.\" The second dummy variable, CONNECTION_non_active, will be coded as 1 for participants in the latter group and 0 for those in the active group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula of the regression model is:\n",
    "WELLNESS_score=β0 + β1 X PSYCHsupport_family_subscale_score + β2 X CONNECTION_active + β3 X CONNECTION_non_active + ϵ\n",
    "\n",
    "β1, β2, β3 denotes the regression coefficients, and ϵ signifies the error term. The model will be fitted using regression analysis software or Python libraries such as statsmodels or sklearn, allowing for the estimation of each coefficient's values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients associated with each independent variable provide insights into their impact on wellness. For instance, the coefficient for PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score indicates the expected change in the wellness score for each one-unit increase in social support. Furthermore, the model's overall goodness of fit will be evaluated using the R-squared value, where a higher R-squared indicates a stronger explanatory power regarding the variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the analysis of regression coefficients, we can find out the significance of PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score and the categorized communication frequency on individuals' wellness and happiness. This regression model elucidates the relationship between these factors and wellness, enabling predictions of WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score based on specified levels of social support and communication frequency, thus enhancing our understanding of their influence on individuals' happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible result：\n",
    "\n",
    "Intercept (β0): 1.0  \n",
    "PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score (β1): 0.5  \n",
    "CONNECTION_active (β2): 0.7  \n",
    "CONNECTION_non_active (β3): -0.3  \n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value of the model is 0.65, indicating that 65% of the variability in the WELLNESS_subjective_happiness_scale_score can be explained by the independent variables in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The regression equation can be expressed as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "WELLNESS_score = \n",
    "WELLNESS_score=2.0+0.5×PSYCH_support_family_subscale_score+0.7×CONNECTION_active−0.3×CONNECTION_non_active\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Intercept (β0 = 1.0): β0 = 1.0 indicates the predicted wellness score when both independent variables (social support and communication frequency) are zero. While it may not have practical significance, it serves as a baseline for the model. This means that the baseline of an individual's wellness is 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. PSYCH_zimet_multidimensional_social_support_family_subscale_score (β1 = 0.5): For each one-unit increase in family social support scores, the wellness score is expected to increase by 0.5 points, while all other factors are fixed. This suggests a positive relationship between family support and subjective happiness, indicating that higher family support contributes to greater overall wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. CONNECTION_active (β2 = 0.7): Individuals grouped in the \"active\" communication group (those who communicate daily, a few times a week, or weekly) are predicted to have a wellness score that is 0.7 points higher than those in the \"non-active\" group, assuming social support scores remain constant. This highlights the importance of regular communication with family for enhancing subjective happiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CONNECTION_non_active (β3 = -0.3): Being in the \"non-active\" group leads to a decrease of 0.3 points. This indicates that less frequent communication with family may negatively（relationship） impact an individual's sense of wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The R-squared value of 0.65 indicates that the model explains a significant portion of the variance in the wellness scores. This suggests that family social support and the frequency of communication contribute meaningfully to understanding subjective happiness, although there may be other factors not captured in this model that could influence wellness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevance to course project's objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression including SLR and MLR is mentioned in our lecture 07. Multiple linear regression analysis is a topic we studied in-depth during the course. In this analysis, we developed a regression model to examine the effects of multiple independent variables (such as family support, social activity, and economic status) on the dependent variable (well-being). The regression equation we used helped us understand the meaning of each independent variable's coefficient (e.g., how much well-being changes for each unit increase in family support), and it allowed us to handle both categorical and numerical data at the same time, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "****4. Conclusion****\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this research(including three analysis) underscores the critical role of family support and communication frequency with families in predicting subjective happiness scores, providing insights for interventions aimed at improving wellness and happiness through enhanced family connections during the pandemic.\n",
